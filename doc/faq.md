# FAQ

### Why am I only getting plain text or HTML?

1. Check your [formatting settings](formatting.md)
2. Some mail servers like Exchange can be
[configured](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa997869%28v=exchg.150%29.aspx)
to only return plain text or HTML and not to deliver mails with alternative contents.
Please connect to your mailbox with a desktop client with the same protocol and check that
the messages contain the version you want to display in confluence. If you can, try to switch from
POP3 to IMAP this might be enough.

### Can I use multiple Mailboxes?

No

### Can I also create pages instead of blog posts?

Currently Mail2Blog can only create blog posts and no pages. However version 2.0, planned for mid 2018, will also be able
to create pages.

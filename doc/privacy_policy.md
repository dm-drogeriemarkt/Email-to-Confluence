## 3. General Information regarding the Data Processing
a) Scope of the data processing
We only collect and use personal data of our users insofar as this is necessary to provide our 
services. The collection and use of personal data of our users regularly takes place only with 
the user’s consent. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be 
obtained for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law. 
b) Legal basis for the processing of personal data
Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 
6 Abs. 1 a) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If the processing of personal data is required for the performance of a contract to which the 
data subject is a party, Art. 6Abs.1 b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to 
processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
Insofar as the processing of personal data is required to fulfil a legal obligation to which our 
company is subject, Art. 6 Abs. 1 c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
If processing is necessary to safeguard a legitimate interest of our company or a third party 
and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the 
first-mentioned interest, Art. 6 Abs. 1 f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing. 
c) Data deletion and storage period
Your personal data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to 
apply. Data may be stored beyond that time if this has been provided for by the European or 
national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which we are subject. 
The data will also be blocked or deleted if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned 
standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or 
fulfilment of a contract.

## 4. Your Rights as Data Subject
You have the following rights towards us regarding your personal data:
•	Right to information,
•	Right to correction or deletion,
•	Right to restrict processing,
•	Right to object to the processing,
•	Right to data transferability.
If you have any questions regarding data protection or your personal data at dm, please 
contact our data protection officer:
by e-mail: datenschutz@dm.de
or by post: dm-drogerie markt GmbH + Co. KG 
Team Datenschutz 
Carl-Metz-Strasse 1 
76185 Karlsruhe
in order to exercise one or more of the aforementioned rights.
If you believe that the processing of personal data concerning you violates the GDPR, you 
have the right of appeal to a supervisory authority, without prejudice to any other remedies.
If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke this at any 
time. Such revocation affects the permissibility of processing your personal data after you 
have given it to us.
If we base the processing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you may object 
to the processing. This is the case if processing is not necessary, in particular, to fulfil a 
contract with you, which is described by us in the following description of the functions. When 
exercising such objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process 
your personal data as we have done. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine 
the situation and either stop or adjust data processing or point out to you our compelling 
reasons for protection, on the basis of which we will continue processing.
Of course, you can object to the processing of your personal data for purposes of advertising 
and data analysis at any time. You can inform us about your advertising contradiction under 
the following contact data: datenschutz@dm.de.

## 5. Information regarding our Server Apps
Unless otherwise stated below we do not process Customer Data via our Server Apps.
With the installation of the Plugin Confluence Add-On E-Mail-to-Confluence you can upload 
e-mails to Confluence and create them as wiki pages. Through this installation and the 
integration of the e-mail account in Confluence, Personal Customer Data such as e-mail 
address and e-mail content (maybe also Personal Data) are processed. Any e-mail account 
can be integrated. 
The data is not processed on our servers but on the customer's server. These data cannot 
be viewed by dm. The customer himself can delete his data so that it is no longer available in 
the Plugin Confluence Add-On E-Mail-to-Confluence. All communication takes place 
between the Plugin Confluence Add-On E-Mail-to-Confluence on the customer's server and 
the mail server configured by the customer. We use access data (user name, password) only 
to the necessary extent for us to communicate with the customer's mail server.
The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 b) GDPR, as the processing of this data is 
necessary for the use of the plug-in and thus for the fulfilment of the contract. dm keeps the 
data until they are no longer needed to provide the function within the plugin or until the 
plugin is deleted - whichever occurs first.

## 6. Access to Customer Data
To some extent, we use external service providers to process your data. These have been 
carefully selected and commissioned by us, are bound by our instructions and are checked 
regularly. Our external service providers our process your personal data on the basis of a 
data protection agreement that complies with legal requirements.
These service providers belong to the following categories:
•	hosting service providers,
•	billing service providers,
•	payment settlement service providers,
•	user authentication service providers,
•	communication service provider,
•	fault and malfunction analysis service providers,
•	analytics service providers,
•	customer relationship management service providers.
Some of the external service providers are located in so-called third countries outside the 
European Union. In order to guarantee an adequate level of data protection, the service 
providers have either (i) submitted to the EU-US Privacy Shield (see 
https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework), or (ii) we have concluded data protection 
agreements with the providers on the basis of the so-called EU standard contract clauses, 
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32010D0087&from=EN.
The inclusion of the service providers is based on Art. 6 Abs. 1 f) GDPR. It is necessary in 
order to be able to provide the services.

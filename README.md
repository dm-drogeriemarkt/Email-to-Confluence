## Origins

The project started off as a fork of the [Confluence-Mail-to-News-Plugin](https://github.com/stimmt/Confluence-Mail-to-News-Plugin) by Liip AG.
But the source code has been completely refactored and we added plenty of new features, bugfixes and tests.
The plugins aren't compatible to another anymore. Therefore we decided to publish this project on its own.
